# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a React-based application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer. It’s built with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and features a user-friendly interface, a chatbot, and a contact form for direct communication.

## Features

### 1. **Portfolio Showcase**

- **Skills**: An organized list of technical skills acquired during the Moringa School Bootcamp.

### 2. **Interactive Chatbot**
- **Ask Questions**: Users can ask the chatbot anything about my portfolio (e.g., "What projects have you worked on?").
- **Customizable Positioning**: The chatbot can be moved to any part of the screen for convenience or hidden entirely if the user prefers not to use it.
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices.

### 3. **Contact Form**

- **Google reCAPTCHA**: Protects the form from spam and abuse.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
